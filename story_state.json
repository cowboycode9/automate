      "text": "The polished marble floor of NovaTech's grand lobby gleams under the harsh glare of overhead lights as Amelia Torres, her worn jeans and faded NovaTech janitorial shirt a stark contrast to the suited crowd, pushes a cart laden with cleaning supplies. Her eyes, a deep, burning brown, dart towards the voices escalating from the conference room.\n\n\"...and I'm telling you, Harrison, this engine will revolutionize\u2014\"\n\n\"I'm telling you, Regina, it's a lemon!\" A man's voice booms, silencing the murmurs. \"You've wasted enough of our investors' money on this pet project!\"\n\nAmelia's heart sinks as she recognizes the voices. She quickens her pace, hoping to avoid the fray, but the conference room doors swing open, and her path is blocked by the departing executives.\n\nRegina Langley, NovaTech's powerful CEO, stands tall, her designer suit impeccable, as she turns to face the crowd gathered in the lobby. Her gaze locks onto Amelia, a calculated smirk spreading across her face.\n\n\"Ah, perfect timing. Everyone, I'd like to introduce you to the daughter of our recently... restructured janitor, Mr. Torres.\" Regina's voice drips with condescension. \"Amelia, isn't it? I've heard so much about your... mechanical prowess. A hobby of yours, I believe?\"\n\nAmelia's cheeks flush as all eyes turn to her. She grips the cart handle tightly, her knuckles white. \"Y-yes, ma'am.\"\n\nRegina strides towards the large, covered podium in the center of the lobby, a draped shape looming behind it. \"We have a bit of a problem with our new engine prototype. Seems our top engineers can't resolve a... slight issue. Amelia, I challenge you: fix what our experts cannot. If you succeed, perhaps we'll consider reinstating your father.\"\n\nThe lobby erupts into a mixture of amused murmurs and disbelieving gasps. Amelia's eyes widen, a storm of emotions brewing inside her. She feels a hand on her shoulder, a gentle squeeze\u2014a silent show of support from an unknown ally in the crowd.\n\n\"I... I don't know if I can\u2014\" Amelia starts, her voice barely audible.\n\nRegina cuts her off, her smile growing wider. \"Oh, but you will try. For your father's sake, won't you, Amelia? You have until our grand unveiling in three days. The blueprints are on the server, under 'Project Aurora.' Don't bother asking for help; it's only fair you work alone, just like your father did... before he was no longer needed here.\"\n\nWith a flourish, Regina rips off the cover, revealing the sleek, futuristic engine. The crowd oohs and aahs, but Amelia's gaze is drawn to the engine's core, her mind already racing with the challenges ahead.\n\nAs the crowd begins to disperse, Regina's parting shot hangs in the air: \"Don't embarrass yourself, Amelia. Or your father.\"\n\nAmelia stands frozen, the cart forgotten, as the CEO disappears into the throng of executives. The gentle hand on her shoulder retracts, leaving behind a small, folded piece of paper with a scribbled message: \"Basement Archives, Tonight, 10 PM. -A Friend.\"\n\nThe engine, once a symbol of innovation, now looms before her, a daunting monument to her impending humiliation or redemption. Amelia's fists clench, determination igniting within her. She whispers to herself, the words a vow: \"I won't back down.\"\n\nWith newfound resolve, Amelia begins to push her cart towards the service elevator, the paper clutched tightly in her fist, her eyes fixed on the engine one last time before vanishing into the depths of the building. The clock on the wall reads 3:47 PM. Seventy-two hours and thirteen minutes until the unveiling."
