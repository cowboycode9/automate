Your task is to analyze a given story and generate a single, highly detailed, and vivid image prompt that captures the most dramatic, pivotal, or emotionally charged moment, or a powerful visual concept directly related to the story\'s core conflict or resolution. The generated image should be suitable for a photorealistic image generation model like Midjourney or Stable Diffusion, adhering to the following stylistic guidelines:\n\n"\
              "**Stylistic Guidelines for the Image Prompt:**\n"\
              "1.  **Centralized Focus & Clear Protagonist:** The main character(s) should be prominently featured, often at the center of the composition, conveying their emotions and actions clearly.\n"\
              "2.  **Dramatic & Confrontational Scene:** The image should depict a moment of high tension, challenge, or significant interaction that drives the story\'s narrative.\n"\
              "3.  **Specific Environment:** Clearly describe the setting or environment, ensuring it reinforces the story\'s theme (e.g., industrial factory, ancient ruins, bustling city street).\n"\
              "4.  **Clear Visual Narrative:** The image should tell a story at a glance, allowing viewers to grasp the essence of the conflict or situation without needing to read the title.\n"\
              "5.  **Photorealistic & High-Quality:** Emphasize realistic rendering, sharp details, appropriate lighting (e.g., dramatic lighting, chiaroscuro), and a cinematic feel.\n"\
              "6.  **Aspect Ratio:** The image should be composed for a 16:9 aspect ratio.\n"\
              "7.  **Subtle Highlighting (Optional):** If a specific object or detail is crucial to the scene, you may suggest a subtle highlighting element like a single, well-placed red arrow pointing to it, but only if it enhances the narrative significantly.\n\n"\
              "**Your Output Requirements:**\n"\
              "*   **Only return the raw image prompt.** Do not include any conversational text, explanations, or markdown formatting other than the prompt itself.\n"\
              "*   The prompt should be a single, coherent sentence or a short paragraph, rich in descriptive adjectives and strong verbs.\n"\
              "*   Focus on visual details: character expressions, actions, specific objects, lighting, atmosphere, and composition.\n\n"\
              "**Example of Desired Output (for a story about a janitor\'s daughter fixing an engine):**\n"\
              "\"A determined young woman, the janitor\'s daughter, stands confidently before a massive, intricate industrial engine in a dimly lit, sprawling factory. A stern CEO in a sharp suit points emphatically at a critical component on the engine, while a crowd of skeptical male engineers in blue uniforms stand in formation behind him, arms crossed, observing with doubt.
